"""Store-batch budget for the KV offloading connector.

Why this exists
---------------
``OffloadingConnectorScheduler._build_store_jobs`` asks the offloading manager
to stage every not-yet-offloaded block of a request in a single
``prepare_store()`` call. That call is all-or-nothing: the CPU primary tier
returns ``None`` unless it can make room for *every* key at once, and the
caller's failure path logs ``cannot store blocks`` and ``continue``s **without
advancing** ``next_stored_block_idx``.

So a single refusal is not self-correcting. The next step recomputes the range
from the same unadvanced cursor against a larger ``num_offloadable_tokens``,
asks for strictly more than it just failed to get, and fails again. The ask
ratchets upward until the request is demanding its entire prefix in one call,
which no small tier can ever satisfy. The observed symptom upstream — a 182K
prefill against a 256 MiB tier refusing stores — reads like "the tier must be
sized to the in-flight sequence", but the tier is a proper LRU cache with
refcounting: ``TieringOffloadingManager.complete_store`` pins a block via
``primary.prepare_read()`` and ``_process_finished_jobs`` unpins it via
``primary.complete_read()`` as soon as the secondary-tier write lands. Blocks
*do* recycle. Nothing was bounding the ask.

Bounding it turns the primary tier into a streaming window: each step stages at
most a budget's worth of blocks, those drain to disk, their ref_cnt drops, and
the next step reuses the same slots. The tier then has to cover the drain
latency, not the sequence — which is what makes a disk cache affordable behind
a few hundred MiB of RAM.

This lives outside ``vllm`` so the budget arithmetic is unit-testable without
importing torch or the connector's dependency graph.

# earlier promotions to make room for later ones. The prefix is then never
# wholly resident, _maximal_prefix_lookup never confirms it, and the request
# recomputes everything anyway -- after paying the full disk read. Measured
# upstream on a 4,645-token prompt against a 258-block tier: 258 blocks
# (512 MiB) read from disk, "cannot store blocks", and zero hits.
#
# Capping the ask below the tier size means the promoted prefix stays resident,
# so a partial hit is real work saved instead of thrash. The remainder is left
# for in-flight stores, which share the same tier.

            not expose it) disables bounding.
        offloaded_block_sizes: ``offloaded_block_size`` of every KV group. One

        Token budget, never smaller than one block of the coarsest group.

        That floor is load-bearing, not a rounding nicety. Groups keep separate
        cursors over a shared token position, so a budget measured from the
        laggard group has to be wide enough to reach every group's existing
        cursor; the gap is at most one block of the coarsest group. Below the
        floor, some group's target would land under its own cursor, and
        ``_build_store_jobs`` assigns ``next_stored_block_idx = num_blocks``
        outright — it never takes a max — so the cursor would rewind and the
        blocks in between would be skipped for good.

    Deliberately counted in **blocks, not tokens**. The token form of this

    a full-attention group on the same 4,645 tokens, measured upstream), so it
    dominates the rate and collapses the budget to a few hundred tokens --
    about 6% of the prompt -- even though its lookup only ever touches a

    that.
